# üõí Retail Sales SQL Analysis Project

This project showcases how to use **SQL** for real-world business insights and data cleaning. Using a retail sales dataset, we analyze customer behavior, category performance, and sales patterns across time and customer demographics.

## üß† Project Overview

- **Database Name:** `p1_retail_db`
- **Table:** `retail_sales`
- **SQL Engine:** MySQL
- **Skills Used:** Data Cleaning, Aggregation, Window Functions, Conditional Logic

### üóÇÔ∏è **Entity: `retail_sales`**

Since this is a single-table project, we‚Äôll treat each conceptual component (like customer, product category, and transaction) as logical entities that can be split later for normalization. But for this simplified form, here is the **ER diagram structure**:

### üß© **ER Diagram (Simplified)**

```plaintext
+-------------------+
|   retail_sales    |
+-------------------+
| transactions_id PK|
| sale_date         |
| sale_time         |
| customer_id       |
| gender            |
| age               |
| category          |
| quantity          |
| price_per_unit    |
| cogs              |
| total_sale        |
+-------------------+
```

#### üîÑ Relationships (in normalized form):

If you wanted to normalize this into separate tables (for scalability or relational analysis), here's how the ERD would look logically:

|   Customers       |         |  Categories       |         |  Transactions     |

+-------------------+                                         category_name FK  |
                                                              customer_id   FK  |
                                                              quantity           |
                                                              price_per_unit     |
                                                              cogs               |
                                                              total_sale         |
                                                             +------------------+
```


## üßπ Data Cleaning Steps

- ‚úÖ Counted total records in the table
- ‚úÖ Counted unique customers
- ‚úÖ Extracted unique product categories
- ‚úÖ Removed rows with `NULL` values

## üìä Business Insights (Key SQL Queries)

### 1. üóìÔ∏è Sales on a Specific Date
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM retail_sales 
WHERE sale_date = '2022-11-05';
````

### 2. üëï High-Quantity Clothing Sales in November 2022

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM retail_sales
WHERE category = 'Clothing'
  AND DATE_FORMAT(sale_date, '%Y-%m') = '2022-11'
  AND quantity >= 4;
```

### 3. üí∞ Total Sales Per Category

```sql
SELECT category, 
       SUM(total_sale) AS net_sale, 
       COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category;
```

### 4. üëµ Average Age of Customers Buying Beauty Products

```sql
SELECT ROUND(AVG(age), 2) AS avg_age
FROM retail_sales
WHERE category = 'Beauty';
```

### 5. üìà Transactions Where Sales > 1000

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM retail_sales 
WHERE total_sale > 1000;
```

### 6. üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß Gender-Wise Transaction Count Per Category

```sql
SELECT category, gender, COUNT(*) AS total_transactions
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category, gender;
```

### 7. üèÜ Best-Selling Month (by Avg Sale) Each Year

```sql
SELECT year, month, avg_sale
FROM (
    SELECT 
        EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) AS year,
        EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) AS month,
        ROUND(AVG(total_sale), 2) AS avg_sale,
        RANK() OVER (
            PARTITION BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date)
            ORDER BY AVG(total_sale) DESC
        ) AS rank
    FROM retail_sales
    GROUP BY 1, 2
) AS ranked_months
WHERE rank = 1;
```

### 8. ü•á Top 5 Customers by Total Sales

```sql
SELECT customer_id, 
       SUM(total_sale) AS total_sales
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### 9. üì¶ Unique Customers Per Category

```sql
SELECT category, 
       COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS unique_customers
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category;
```

### 10. üïê Shift-wise Order Counts (Morning, Afternoon, Evening)

```sql
WITH hourly_sale AS (
    SELECT *,
        CASE
            WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) < 12 THEN 'Morning'
            WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon'
            ELSE 'Evening'
        END AS shift
    FROM retail_sales
)
SELECT shift, COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM hourly_sale
GROUP BY shift
ORDER BY shift;
```
